### Resources
- [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) - Official guide
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) - Algorithm practice platform
- Book: "Clean Code" by Robert Martin - Chapters 1-3

### Reflections
> React hooks finally clicked this week after building three small projects. The key was understanding hooks as a way to "hook into" React features, not just random functions. State management feels much more intuitive now.
```

### Reflections
> Consistency is more important than intensity. I feel better after a week of moderate, consistent exercise than I do after sporadic intense workouts. Building the habit of showing up is the real win, even on days when I don't feel motivated.
```

### Key Wins 🎉

**What to Include:**
- Most significant achievements of the week
- Meaningful progress on goals
- Breakthroughs or "aha" moments
- Completed milestones

**Guidelines:**
- List 2-4 wins (3 is ideal)

- Frame challenges as learning opportunities

**Examples:**
```markdown
### Challenges Faced 🤔
1. Struggled with async JavaScript concepts - spent extra time building projects to practice rather than just reading documentation
2. Felt overwhelmed balancing learning time with work commitments - adjusted schedule to focus on one main topic per day instead of trying to do everything
```

```

## Navigation Links

### Footer Format
Every weekly README must end with navigation links:

```markdown
### Navigation
[← Previous Week](../week-XX/README.md) | [Main README](../../../README.md) | [Next Week →](../week-XX/README.md)
```

### Link Calculation Rules

**Previous Week Link:**
- Format: `../week-XX/README.md`
- For Week 01: Can point to main README or be omitted
- For Week 02+: Points to previous week (Week 02 → Week 01)
- Use relative path (../ goes up one directory)

**Main README Link:**
- Format: `../../../README.md`
- Always points to repository root README
- Same for all weeks: up 3 levels (week folder → year folder → weeks folder → root)

**Next Week Link:**
- Format: `../week-XX/README.md`
- For most recent week: Can be incomplete or point to main README
- For older weeks: Points to next week (Week 01 → Week 02)
- Update when new weeks are added

### Examples by Position

**Week 01 (First Week):**
```markdown
[Main README](../../../README.md) | [Next Week →](../week-02/README.md)
```

**Week 02 (Middle Week):**
```markdown
[← Previous Week](../week-01/README.md) | [Main README](../../../README.md) | [Next Week →](../week-03/README.md)
```

**Week 52 (Latest Week):**
```markdown
[← Previous Week](../week-51/README.md) | [Main README](../../../README.md)
```

## Content Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Copy Template
```bash
cp weeks/TEMPLATE.md weeks/2026/week-XX/README.md
```

### Step 2: Update Header
Use datetime.skill to determine:
- Week number (XX)
- Year (YYYY)
- Date range (Month DD - Month DD)

```markdown
# Week 01, 2026 (January 17 - January 23)
```

### Step 3: Write Week at a Glance
Craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing:
- Main focus or theme of the week
- Key achievement or learning
- Context that makes it interesting

**Good Examples:**
> **Week at a Glance**: Dove deep into React hooks this week, building three projects that finally made state management click. Also started tracking finances more carefully after reading about compound interest.

> **Week at a Glance**: First week of structured learning! Set up this journal system and explored multiple domains. Excited to see this grow over time.

**Avoid:**
- Too vague: "Learned some stuff and did things"
- Too long: More than 2-3 sentences
- Just listing: "Did AI, finance, and fitness"

### Step 4: Fill Topic Sections
For each of the six topics:
1. Decide if you have content (it's OK to skip topics some weeks)
2. If yes, fill in relevant subsections
3. Include at least "What I Learned" and "Reflections"
4. Other subsections can be empty if no content

**Handling Empty Topics:**
- Option 1: Remove the entire topic section (not recommended - breaks structure)
- Option 2: Leave section with empty subsections (recommended - maintains structure)
- Option 3: Add a brief note: "No significant learning in this area this week"

### Step 5: Complete Week Summary
- Add 2-4 key wins (meaningful accomplishments)
- Add 1-3 challenges (with how you addressed them)
- Add 2-5 forward-looking items

### Step 6: Update Navigation
- Calculate previous week number (current - 1)
- Update Previous Week link if not Week 01
- Leave Next Week link empty if this is the latest week
- Verify relative paths are correct

### Step 7: Review and Polish
Use content-format.skill standards:
- Check markdown syntax
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Verify headers follow hierarchy
- Test that structure is complete
- Proofread for typos
