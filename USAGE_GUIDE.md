## 📝 Content Guidelines

### What to Include

For each topic category, consider documenting:

- **What I Learned**: New concepts, facts, or insights
- **Actions/Practice**: What you actually did (projects, exercises, activities)
- **Resources**: Books, articles, videos, courses that helped you learn
- **Reflections**: Your thoughts, feelings, and insights about the learning

### Keep It Authentic

- Don't worry about being perfect - this is a learning journal, not a polished blog
- Be honest about challenges and failures
- Include both big and small learnings
- It's okay to skip topics where you didn't learn anything that week
