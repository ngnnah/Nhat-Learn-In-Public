## Why This Book?

You don't need weeks off or a plane ticket to have an adventure. Humphreys—a National Geographic Adventurer of the Year—proves that epic experiences hide in your backyard. Sleep on a hill, swim at dawn, bike somewhere new. **Adventure is a mindset, not a destination.**

Perfect antidote to "I'll travel when I have time/money."
