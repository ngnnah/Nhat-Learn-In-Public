# Cascade Bakery — My New Favorite Local Spot in Osaka

**🍞 Best bread I've ever had — even better than European breads.**

Found this gem near my home in Osaka: [Cascade Kobe Bakery](https://www.cascade-kobe.co.jp/sp/about/)

## Why It's Special

- **Shuzake Yeast** — Natural leaven made from rice/koji, giving subtle Japanese flavor and unique texture
- **Hokkaido wheat** — Premium Japanese ingredients sourced directly from Hokkaido
- **Signature: Gokoku Shichifuku Pan** (五穀七福 = "5 grains, 7 fortunes") — Brown rice flour, sunflower seeds, malt, oats, linseed & soybeans. Dense yet airy, rich in fiber and minerals.

## What I Love

- Cheap, healthy, tasty — the trifecta
- Natural flavors, not overly sweet
- Wholesome ingredients, guilt-free eating
- Combines traditional Japanese bread-making with health-conscious baking

## Must-Try Items: Everything!
