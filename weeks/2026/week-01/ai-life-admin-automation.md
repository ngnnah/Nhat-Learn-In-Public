# Quick Tip: AI for Parsing Travel Emails → Calendar Events

**Use Cases**:
- Gym confirmation in Japanese
- Hotel booking confirmations
- Flight tickets with multiple stops/time zones

**Sample Prompt**:
> "Create a full detail .ics file for me to import to my iCal, with all info especially related to fees, check-in times, and policies."

**Why AI Excels Here**:
- **Language barriers**: Parses Japanese, Korean, or any language without manual translation
- **Time zone handling**: A multi-leg flight (Tokyo → Dubai → London) gets each segment in the correct local time zone
- **Hidden details humans miss**: Cancellation policies, "NO CASH" rules, baggage restrictions, early check-in fees, rental gear requirements
- **Web navigation**: Can check airline/hotel websites for details not in the email (baggage allowance, loyalty points, etc.)

**Example Output**: One `.ics` import and your calendar has:
- Flight segments with correct departure/arrival time zones
- Hotel check-in/out times in local time
- Payment warnings, confirmation numbers, and direct links

---

💡 **Takeaway**: Paste any confirmation email (any language) + ask for `.ics` = actionable calendar events with details you'd otherwise miss.
