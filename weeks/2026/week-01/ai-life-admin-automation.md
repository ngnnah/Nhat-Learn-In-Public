# Quick Tip: AI for Foreign Language Emails → Calendar Events

**The Problem**: Got a gym confirmation email in Japanese with times, payment rules, and gear requirements buried in the text.

**The Prompt**:
> "Create a full detail .ics file for me to import to my iCal, with all info especially related to fees and usage."

**The Result**: Double-clicked the generated `.ics` file and my calendar had:
- Correct time zone
- "NO CASH ACCEPTED" warning
- "Bring socks for rental shoes" note
- Cancellation & coupon links

💡 **Takeaway**: AI isn't just for coding—it extracts actionable info from foreign languages and puts it where you need it.
