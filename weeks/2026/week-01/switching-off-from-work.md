> Source: [The Guardian - The perfect way to switch off from work](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/19/the-perfect-way-to-switch-off-from-work-how-to-detach-and-de-stress)

## The Problem

- **55%** of employees feel pressed to respond to calls/emails outside work hours
- Remote workers often work **longer hours** than office-based workers
- Constantly being "on" leads to: fatigue, sleep problems, strained relationships, weakened immunity, cognitive impairment

## The Recovery Paradox

The more stressed you are at work, the harder it is to detach — yet you need recovery the most when you're most stressed.

> "Greater exposure to job stressors simultaneously calls for but prevents recovery." — Prof. Sabine Sonnentag

## Practical Strategies

### End-of-Day Rituals
- **Write tomorrow's to-do list** before leaving — prevents rumination
- Tidy your desk, close the door (physical separation)
- Create a Pavlovian cue: movement, loud music, Wordle — signals brain "work is done"

### Create Boundaries
- Mute work notifications after hours
- Remove work apps from personal phone (or use separate work phone)
- Set out-of-office messages with your working hours
- Communicate boundaries clearly — makes everyone's life easier

### Recovery Activities
Research identifies three effective strategies:
1. **Physical activity** — exercise, gym, walking
2. **Social connection** — time with friends and family
3. **Engaging hobbies** — sewing, gardening, pottery

### The DRAMMA Model
Six elements for workplace wellbeing:
- **D**etachment — mentally disconnect
- **R**elaxation — unwind
- **A**utonomy — control over leisure time
- **M**astery — complete challenges that boost self-worth
- **M**eaning — purposeful activities
- **A**ffiliation — social connection

## Key Insight

It's not about the specific activity (bath, meditation, etc.) — it's about the **recovery experience** during the activity. What works for one person may not work for another.

## Why It Matters

- 1 in 5 UK workers remain at high risk of burnout
- Most burnout cases begin with people **loving their jobs**
- Even positive work thoughts can be exhausting — everyone needs downtime
- Psychological detachment **improves productivity** when you are working
