# AI Use Case Discovery Framework

## 🎯 Goal
Master a systematic 5-step framework to identify, evaluate, and prioritize AI use cases that deliver measurable business value for both internal operations and customer-facing initiatives.

## 📖 What I Learned

Organizations often jump into AI projects based on vague ambitions or "shiny" capabilities rather than specific business value. This framework provides a disciplined approach to discovering the right AI use cases before you build.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- [ ] Cross-functional team access (product, business, tech, support, marketing)
- [ ] Understanding of your customer journey
- [ ] Knowledge of internal business processes
- [ ] Template/worksheet for capturing use cases (provided below)

## ⏱️ Time Estimate
- Initial workshop: 2-4 hours
- Use case mapping: 1-2 weeks
- Ongoing iteration: continuous

## 📋 The 5-Step Framework

### Step 1: Establish Processes

**What**: Set up the right discovery structure before brainstorming
**Why**: Ensures you capture specific, actionable insights instead of vague ideas
**How**:

1. **Encourage storytelling**: Ask for real examples, "a day in the life," and what "great" would look like
2. **Push for specificity**: Avoid generic descriptions—get to the real workflow, queries, and desired outcomes
3. **Use a template**: Provide a worksheet or digital form for each use case (see Step 4)
4. **Invite the right mix**: Include product, business, tech, support, marketing, and—for external use cases—customers
5. **Document nuance**: Capture unwritten rules, workarounds, and best practices

> 💡 **Tip**: Document everything clearly—you'll need these details if the project moves to implementation

### Step 2: Brain Dump Ideas Into Internal & External Buckets

**What**: Generate ideas across two domains without filtering
**Why**: Ensures you don't miss high-impact opportunities in either area

**External Use Cases** (Customer-Facing):
- Customer support automation
- Intelligent search
- Digital onboarding
- Product recommendations
- Personalization engines
- In-app assistants
- Wishlist features from customer perspective

**Internal Use Cases** (Operations):
- Contract review
- HR onboarding
- Invoice processing
- Compliance checks
- Repetitive, rules-driven tasks
- Bottleneck elimination

> 💡 **Tip**: Think both broadly and specifically—don't self-censor at this stage

---

### Step 3: Map the Customer Journey & Business Processes

**What**: Place use cases within actual workflows and journeys
**Why**: Reveals dependencies, priorities, and realistic integration points

**For External Journeys**:
1. Put yourself in customers' shoes
2. Map: First interaction → Onboarding → Engagement → Support → Retention
3. Identify friction points and delight opportunities
4. Consider post-journey (e.g., churn causes)

**For Internal Processes**:
1. Talk to various teams about automation needs
2. Tie pain points to specific workflows
3. Consider both high-volume tasks and "long tail" activities
4. Track cumulative cost or risk drivers

> 💡 **Tip**: Don't restrict to what's easy—push for what's valuable and specific

---

### Step 4: Capture Structured Use Cases

**What**: Document each use case with critical details
**Why**: Enables objective evaluation and prioritization

Use this worksheet for each use case:

| Field | Question | Example (Internal) | Example (External) |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Problem Statement** | What is the pain/inefficiency or opportunity? | Processing expense reports is slow | Customers can't easily get product advice |
| **Who is Impacted?** | Internal users (roles/depts) or customer segment | Finance team | End customers (mobile app users) |
| **Persona/Segment** | Target employee type or customer persona | Accounts payable clerk | New shoppers, returning buyers |
| **Sample Questions/Tasks** | Typical queries or actions | "Is this expense valid?" | "What's the best running shoe for me?" |
| **Touchpoints/Channels** | Where does this occur? | Internal portal, email | Mobile app, website chatbot |
| **Business/Experience Benefit** | Time saved, accuracy, satisfaction, revenue, NPS uplift | Faster cycle time, cost savings | Higher conversion, improved NPS |
| **Volume/Frequency** | How often? How many users/transactions? | 200 reports/week | 10,000 queries/month |
| **Current Process/Pain** | Description of current workflow, friction points, costs | Manual, error-prone | Manual search/filtering, low satisfaction |
| **Potential Risks** | What could go wrong? (privacy, accuracy, compliance, brand) | Missed fraud, compliance errors | Wrong or biased recommendations |
| **Strategic Priority** | How important is this to company goals? | Medium | High |
| **Feasibility** | Is needed data/process access available? | Data is available | Need access to support/product content |

> ⚠️ **Watch out**: Don't skip the worksheet—it forces you to think through details you'll need later

### Step 5: Prioritize Holistically

**What**: Score and rank use cases across multiple dimensions
**Why**: Ensures you invest in the right projects first

Evaluate each use case on:

1. **Impact**: Business value, customer experience, revenue/cost savings
2. **Feasibility**: Data readiness, process access, technical complexity
3. **Risk**: Brand impact, compliance, operational implications
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Does it advance key company initiatives?

**Prioritization Strategy**:
- Start with **quick wins**: Simpler internal automations first
- Build your "AI transformation muscle" before high-risk external projects
- Balance short-term wins with long-term strategic goals

> 💡 **Tip**: Consider creating a 2x2 matrix of Impact vs. Feasibility to visualize priorities

## ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Systematic beats ad-hoc**: A unified discovery approach prevents missed opportunities
2. **Internal + External**: Don't silo—consider both domains from the start
3. **Specificity matters**: Vague ideas lead to failed projects; details drive success
4. **Start simple**: Build capability with internal automations before complex external projects
5. **Iterate continuously**: This framework is not one-and-done; revisit regularly

## 🎯 When to Use This

- Starting a new AI transformation initiative
- Quarterly strategic planning sessions
- When stakeholders propose "AI for X" without specifics
- Before committing budget to AI projects
- When building a roadmap for AI maturity

## 💭 My Reflection

The most valuable insight is the emphasis on **specificity over ambition**. Many AI projects fail because they start with "let's use AI for customer support" instead of "automate password reset confirmations that consume 15% of support time." The worksheet in Step 4 forces the right level of detail.

Also appreciated the emphasis on **starting with internal use cases** first—it's a smart way to build organizational AI competency with lower risk before tackling customer-facing applications.

The framework is **iterative and inclusive**, not a one-time exercise. The cross-functional team approach ensures you capture needs across the organization.
