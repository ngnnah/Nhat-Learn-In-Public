> *Inspired by Shutter Island (2010) & The Last Frontier (2025)*

## 🏆 The OG Federal Law Enforcement

**US Marshals are the OLDEST federal law enforcement agency in the United States.**

- Created: **September 24, 1789** by the Judiciary Act
- Signed by: **George Washington** himself
- First 13 Marshals appointed by Washington — many were Revolutionary War veterans

## 📊 By the Numbers

| Stat                 | Number                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **District offices** | 94 across the US + territories |
| **Headquarters**     | Arlington, Virginia            |

### Marshal vs Deputy — What's the Difference?

| Role                  | Who They Are                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **US Marshal**        | The boss — 1 per federal judicial district (94 total). Appointed by the President, confirmed by Senate. 4-year term. |
| **Deputy US Marshal** | The workers — career law enforcement officers who do the actual fieldwork (fugitive hunting, protection, transport). |

**Think of it like**: Marshal = Sheriff (elected/appointed leader), Deputies = the officers who work under them.

### Training Comparison: Marshal vs Navy SEAL

| Aspect                      | US Marshal                                                     | Navy SEAL                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Training**        | 21.5 weeks                                                     | 12+ months (BUD/S + SQT)                       |
| **Location**                | Glynco, Georgia                                                | Coronado, California                           |
| **Focus**                   | Law enforcement, firearms, court procedures, prisoner handling | Combat diving, land warfare, extreme endurance |
| **"Hell Week" equivalent?** | No                                                             | Yes — 5.5 days, ~4 hours sleep total           |
| **Dropout rate**            | Lower                                                          | 75%+ drop out during Hell Week                 |
| **Post-training**           | Assigned to district                                           | 18+ months pre-deployment training             |

**TL;DR**: SEAL training is ~3x longer and designed to break you physically/mentally. Marshal training is rigorous but focused on law enforcement skills rather than special warfare.
