# Roth vs Traditional 401(k): The Math That Matters

Maxing out your 401(k) is great. But **Roth or Traditional?** This choice can mean $500k-$1.5M difference by retirement.

## The Core Trade-off

**Traditional 401(k):**
- ✅ Tax deduction NOW (e.g., save $5,640 on $23,500 contribution at 24% bracket)
- ❌ Pay taxes LATER (on contributions + all growth)

**Roth 401(k):**
- ❌ NO tax deduction NOW (pay full taxes on income)
- ✅ Tax-free withdrawals LATER (contributions + growth, if qualified*)

*Qualified = 5+ years after first contribution AND age 59.5+

## The Math: 35 Years at Age 30

Max contribution: $23,500/year from age 30 to 65.

| Return Rate | Balance at 65 | Roth (After-Tax) | Traditional (After-Tax at 22%)** |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **5%**      | $2.23M        | **$2.23M**       | $1.74M                           |
| **8%**      | $4.37M        | **$4.37M**       | $3.41M                           |
| **11%**     | $9.65M        | **$9.65M**       | $7.53M                           |

**Roth advantage: $490k to $2.1M depending on returns and retirement tax bracket**

**Assumes 22% retirement bracket. If 12% bracket, subtract 12% instead of 22%.

## Why Traditional Can Win: The Tax Savings Investment

**The case for Traditional isn't just the deduction—it's what you DO with the tax savings.**

### Example: $23,500 contribution at 24% tax bracket

**Roth approach:**
- Contribute $23,500 Roth (paid with after-tax dollars)
- Total out-of-pocket: $23,500

**Traditional approach:**
- Contribute $23,500 Traditional 
- Get $5,640 tax refund (24% of $23,500)
- Invest that $5,640 in taxable brokerage
- Total out-of-pocket: $23,500

**After 35 years at 8% return:**
- Traditional 401(k): $4.37M (taxed at withdrawal)
- Tax savings invested: $96k (after capital gains tax)
- **Total: $4.47M** (before 401(k) withdrawal tax)

**The Traditional advantage evaporates IF:**
1. You're in same/higher tax bracket in retirement (22%+)
2. You don't invest the tax savings (most people don't!)
3. You withdraw large amounts triggering higher brackets

**The Roth advantage grows IF:**
1. Tax rates increase in the future
2. Your retirement income stays in 22%+ bracket
3. You want flexibility (Roth withdrawals don't count as taxable income)

## When to Choose What

### ✅ Choose Roth if:
- **Age 20-40** with 25+ years until retirement
- **Tax bracket ≤ 24%** (most young professionals)
- **Expect career growth** into higher brackets
- **Won't invest tax savings** (be honest—most don't!)

### ✅ Choose Traditional if:
- **Tax bracket ≥ 32%** (immediate savings too good)
- **Will actually invest tax refund** in taxable account
- **100% certain** of lower retirement bracket (rare!)
- **Within 10 years of retirement**

### 🤝 Best Strategy: Mix Both (60% Roth, 40% Traditional)
- Get some immediate tax benefit
- Build tax-free bucket for retirement
- Hedge against unknown future tax rates

## Key Factors Often Missed

**1. Employer match is ALWAYS Traditional**
- Even 100% Roth contributions get Traditional match
- You'll pay tax on that match in retirement

**2. Roth withdrawals don't count as income**
- Won't increase Social Security taxation
- Won't trigger Medicare premium surcharges (IRMAA)
- Won't push you into higher capital gains brackets

**3. The 5-year rule**
- Must wait 5 years + age 59.5 for tax-free Roth withdrawals
- Start the clock early!

## Common Mistakes

❌ **"I'll be in a lower bracket"** - With $4M+ saved, RMDs alone keep you in 22%+ bracket

❌ **"Math is same if tax rates equal"** - No! When maxing out, Roth = more after-tax invested

❌ **Choosing Traditional but spending the tax refund** - Makes Traditional much worse

## The Verdict

**For professionals under 40 in 22-24% bracket: Roth wins by $500k-$1.5M**

The younger you are, the more Roth wins. 35 years of tax-free compounding is powerful.

**Switch to Traditional only if:**
1. Income jumps to 32%+ bracket
2. You religiously invest every tax refund dollar
3. You're certain of 12% retirement bracket (very rare with $2M+)
