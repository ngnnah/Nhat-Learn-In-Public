## 🎮 Go Basics (ELI5)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Go (English), Baduk (Korean), Weiqi (Chinese) |
| **Origin** | China, ~4,000 years ago |
| **Board** | 19×19 grid (361 intersections) |
| **Pieces** | Black and white stones |
| **Goal** | Control more territory than opponent |
| **Rules** | Incredibly simple, near-infinite complexity |

**Why Go is hard for computers**: The number of possible board positions (~10^170) exceeds atoms in the universe. Until 2016, experts thought AI mastering Go was decades away.

## 🥋 The Dan Ranking System

Created by **Honinbo Dosaku** in 17th-century Japan (he's in the GOAT list below).

| Rank Type | Range | Level |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Kyu** (級) | 30k → 1k | Student ranks (count down) |
| **Amateur Dan** (段) | 1d → 7d | Master ranks (count up) |
| **Professional Dan** | 1p → 9p | Elite — requires passing qualification exam |

**Key points:**
- 1 dan = "black belt" equivalent — you've mastered the fundamentals
- 1 rank difference ≈ 1 handicap stone in even games
- Pro ranks are separate: a 1p is ~7d amateur strength, but 1p→9p span is only 2-3 stones
- Top players today use Elo ratings (e.g., Shin Jinseo at 3856) for precise comparison

## 🤖 Go After AlphaGo (2016-Present)

### The Historic Match

- **March 2016**: AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol (5 games)
- **Result**: AlphaGo wins 4-1
- **Move 37**: AI played a "1-in-10,000" move Lee Sedol called "incredibly creative"
- **Game 4**: Lee Sedol won one game — possibly humanity's last victory over top Go AI

### What Changed

| Before AI | After AI |
|-----------|----------|
| Players had distinct styles | Everyone trains with AI, styles converging |
| "Joseki" (established patterns) sacred | AI proved many ancient patterns were suboptimal |
| 3-3 invasion considered "rude" | Now played constantly |
| Learning from human masters | Learning from AI at home |

### The AI Era Players

- **Shin Jinseo** (Korea) — First to break 3800 Elo, trained extensively with AI
- No human has beaten top AI since 2017 (AlphaGo Master went 60-0 online)

### Lee Sedol's Retirement (2019)

> "Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated."

He now designs board games and teaches game design — focusing on what AI cannot do: *create games*.
