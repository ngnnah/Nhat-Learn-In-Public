# Padel vs Pickleball: A Quick Comparison

## What is Padel?

Think of padel as **pickleball's European cousin that grew up in a glass cage**. It's a racquet sport that looks like tennis had a baby with squash, played on a court surrounded by walls you can bounce the ball off—like racquetball but with a partner.

## The Quick Comparison

| Feature | Padel | Pickleball |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Court Size** | 66 × 33 ft (bigger) | 44 × 20 ft (smaller) |
| **Walls** | Yes! Glass/mesh walls you play off | No walls |
| **Racquet** | Solid paddle (no strings) | Solid paddle (no strings) |
| **Ball** | Tennis ball (less pressure) | Wiffle ball (plastic with holes) |
| **Serving** | Underhand, must bounce first | Underhand, below waist |
| **Scoring** | Like tennis (15-30-40) | Rally scoring to 11 |
| **Players** | Always doubles (4 players) | Mostly doubles, can be singles |
| **Strategy** | Wall bounces = more rallies | Net play dominates |
| **Where Popular** | Spain, Latin America, Europe | USA, Canada |

## Key Differences for Pickleball Players

**What's Similar:**
- Both use solid paddles (not stringed racquets)
- Both favor doubles play
- Both are easier on joints than tennis
- Both have a "kitchen"/no-volley zone concept

**What's Different:**
- **The walls change everything**: In padel, you can play balls off the back and side walls (like squash), making rallies longer and more dynamic
- **Court is enclosed**: You're literally playing in a cage—balls that hit the wall are still in play
- **More running**: Bigger court + wall rebounds = more cardio
- **Different ball**: Padel uses a depressurized tennis ball (softer, slower) vs pickleball's plastic ball

## Bottom Line

**Try padel if** you enjoyed pickleball but want:
- Longer rallies with more back-and-forth
- More dynamic movement and strategy
- A sport that's exploding internationally

**Stick with pickleball if** you prefer:
- Simpler rules without wall play
- Smaller courts (less running)
- More accessible courts in the USA

Both are fun, social, and way easier to pick up than tennis!
