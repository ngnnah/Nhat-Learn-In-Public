## The Ten Commandments

| # | Commandment | Key Insight |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Triage** | Focus on questions where effort pays off. Skip the too-easy and the impossible. |
| 2 | **Break Problems Down** | Use Fermi-style decomposition. Subdivide complex questions to reveal hidden assumptions. |
| 3 | **Balance Inside & Outside Views** | Ask: "How have similar situations unfolded before?" Don't treat every case as unique. |
| 4 | **Update Your Beliefs** | Revise rationally as new info emerges. Detect signals in noise, resist wishful thinking. |
| 5 | **Everything is Connected** | Acknowledge counterarguments. Develop nuanced, hybrid perspectives. |
| 6 | **Remove Uncertainty** | Convert vague hunches into specific numeric estimates through practice. |
| 7 | **Balance Prudence & Decisiveness** | Avoid both premature judgment and excessive hesitation. |
| 8 | **Learn from Failure and Success** | Document decisions, analyze outcomes honestly, extract lessons from both. |
| 9 | **Manage the Team** | Cultivate perspective-taking, precision questioning, and constructive disagreement. |
| 10 | **Master the Error-Balancing Bicycle** | Real mastery requires deliberate practice with immediate feedback, not just theory. |
