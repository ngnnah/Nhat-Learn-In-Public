## Why This Game?

**Learn in 1 minute. Play for hours. Works with anyone, anywhere.** I've introduced this to countless groups—different ages, languages, backgrounds—and it never fails to create instant fun and connection.

## Origin & Name

**From Russia to Japan:** Originally created in Russia, the game was introduced to Japan in 2016 where it gained massive popularity.

**"Nanja Monja" (なんじゃもんじゃ):** A Japanese expression roughly meaning "What the heck is that?" or "What on earth?"—loosely translatable to English as "WTF?!" The name perfectly captures the reaction to seeing bizarre creatures and hearing the ridiculous names people invent for them.

## Card Setup: Original vs DIY

**Original Nanja Monja:**
- **60 cards total** featuring 12 different creatures
- Each creature appears on **5 cards**
- Designed for optimal gameplay balance

**The Beautiful Flexibility:**

You can use **any deck** with **any card count** and **any distribution**:

- **52-card deck**: Use all 4 suits (13 cards per set) or mix suits for variety
- **Uno deck**: 4 colors with 0-9 + special cards = plenty of visual variety
- **Themed decks**: Pokemon, Mario, animals—anything with distinct images
- **Custom counts**: Start with 20 cards for quick games, scale up to 100+ for chaos

**Distribution options:**
- **Even sets** (4 cards each): Predictable—good for beginners
- **Uneven sets** (2-6 cards each): Adds surprise—when will that card appear again?
- **Mixed deck**: Combine multiple decks for wild variety

The game works with **literally any combination**—the core mechanic (name it, remember it, shout it) stays fun regardless of deck composition.

## How to Play

**Setup:** Place a deck of cards (any deck with distinct visuals) face-down in the center.

**Gameplay:**
1. Optionally choose a naming theme (animals, foods, celebrities, etc.)

3. First person to see a NEW visual names it (silly names encouraged!)
4. When that visual appears again, race to shout its name
5. Correct person takes the pile
6. Most cards at end wins

**The magic:** Watching people struggle to remember the ridiculous names they just invented!
