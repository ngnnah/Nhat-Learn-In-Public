# 🎴 Nanja Monja: An Accessible Memory Card Game

## What is it?

A memory card game where you flip cards and make up names for them. When the same card appears again, everyone races to shout its name. Get it right, you keep the pile. Most cards wins.

That's literally the entire rule set. Takes under a minute to explain.

## Why I keep teaching this to people

I've introduced this to everyone from grandparents to kids, coworkers to friends from different countries. It works every time because:

- No advantage from age, language, or gaming experience
- Games are quick (5 minutes) but you end up playing for hours
- Creates inside jokes immediately

**Fun fact:** Originally Russian, became popular in Japan in 2016. "Nanja Monja" (なんじゃもんじゃ) means "what the heck?" in Japanese.

## The best part: naming

You're not limited to names. Phrases work great:

- "Princess Bananas" or "Captain Sparkles"  
- "Easy peasy lemon squeezy"
- "Not my circus not my monkeys"
- Movie quotes, song lyrics, whatever

The real fun is watching someone panic when they can't remember what they JUST named a card 30 seconds ago.

## Setup

**Original game:** 60 cards (12 creatures, 5 cards each)

**DIY:** Use any deck—standard 52-card, Uno, Pokemon. Start with 20 cards for quick games, or use 100+ for chaos.

## My favorite house rule

After a few warm-up rounds, require **3+ word minimum** for all names. 

Single words become illegal. "Bob" must become "Bob's your uncle" or nothing. Forces creativity and makes the memory challenge way harder (and funnier).

## Where to get it

Official version at game stores or online. Or just use any cards you have.
