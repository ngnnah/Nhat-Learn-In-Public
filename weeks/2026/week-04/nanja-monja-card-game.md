# 🎴 Nanja Monja: The Most Accessible Memory Card Game

## TLDR: The Game

Flip cards and invent silly names or phrases for new visuals—when a card reappears, race to shout what you called it. Winner keeps the pile; most cards wins.

## 💡 Why I Love This Game

**60-second rules. 5-minute rounds. Endless replayability.** 

Introduced to grandparents, coworkers, language exchange meetups across ages and cultures. Every single time: instant laughter and connection.

**Origin:** Created in Russia, popularized in Japan (2016). **"Nanja Monja" (なんじゃもんじゃ)** = "What the heck?!" or "WTF?!"—perfectly capturing reactions to bizarre creatures and ridiculous names.

---

## 📦 Original Game vs DIY

**Original:** 60 cards, 12 creatures, 5 each

**DIY flexibility:** Any deck works—52-card, Uno, Pokemon. Use 20 cards for quick games or 100+ for chaos. Even/uneven distribution both work.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Flip card → First person names/phrases it
2. Same card reappears → Race to shout it
3. Correct shout → Takes the pile
4. Most cards wins

**🎨 The REAL fun: Naming creativity!** 
- Names: "Princess Bananas," "Captain Sparkles"
- Common phrases: "Easy peasy lemon squeezy," "Piece of cake," "Not my circus not my monkeys"
- Movie quotes, song lyrics, inside jokes—anything goes!
- The panic when you can't remember what YOU just named it 😂

**Universal:**
- No age/language/gaming advantage
- Inside jokes form instantly
- Anyone can teach it

**Practical:**

**Best moment:** Someone desperately shouting wrong variations while the table erupts 🤣

## 🎲 Tips & House Rules

1. **Phrases > words** — "Easy peasy lemon squeezy" > "Green Guy"
2. **🔥 My favorite rule:** After warm-up rounds, require **2+ or 3+ word minimum**—forces creativity, makes recall hilariously harder
3. **Themed decks** level up the fun
4. **Start with 15-20 cards** for newbies
5. **Embrace the chaos** 📣
