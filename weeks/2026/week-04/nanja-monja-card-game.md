# Nanja Monja: The Most Accessible Memory Card Game

## The Game in 2 Sentences

Flip cards and invent silly names or phrases for new visuals—when a card reappears, race to shout what you called it. Winner keeps the pile; most cards at the end wins.

## Why I Love This Game

**60-second rules. 5-minute rounds. Endless replayability.** I've introduced this to countless groups across ages, languages, and cultures—from grandparents to coworkers to language exchange meetups. Every single time: instant laughter and connection.

**Origin:** Created in Russia, popularized in Japan (2016). **"Nanja Monja" (なんじゃもんじゃ)** = Japanese for "What the heck?!" or loosely "WTF?!"—perfectly capturing reactions to the bizarre creatures and silly names.

## Original Game Specs

- **60 cards:** 12 different creatures, 5 cards each
- Optimal balance for gameplay

**DIY Flexibility:** Works with any deck—52-card standard, Uno, Pokemon, themed cards. Use 20 cards for quick games or 100+ for chaos. Even/uneven distribution both work. The core mechanic (name it, remember it, shout it) is fun regardless of setup.

## How to Play

1. Flip card → First person seeing NEW visual names it (or phrases it!)
2. Same visual reappears → Race to shout its name/phrase
3. Correct shout → Takes the pile
4. Most cards wins

**The REAL fun: The naming creativity!** 
- Names work: "Princess Bananas," "Mr. Fancy Pants"
- Common or ridiculous phrases work brilliantly: "What goes around comes around," "My butt is losing my mind"
- Themed naming (optional): animals, foods, celebrities, movie quotes, song lyrics
- The panic-memory moment when you're desperately trying to recall what you named it 30 seconds ago

## Why It Works Everywhere

**Universal Appeal:**
- No language/age/gaming advantage
- Creates inside jokes instantly
- Anyone can teach it forward

**Practical:**
- Zero prep, ultra-portable
- Any player count (2 to 20+)
- Play one round or marathon

**My best moment:** Someone shouting five wrong names while inventing increasingly desperate variations of "what goes around comes around!"

## Tips & House Rules

1. **Phrases > single words** — "My brain has gone deep south" > "Upside down"
2. **My favorite house rule:** After a few warm-up rounds, require **2+ or 3+ word minimum** for all names. Forces creativity and makes recall hilariously harder
3. **Themed decks** (Pokemon, Mario) add visual interest
4. **Start with 15-20 cards** for beginners
5. **Embrace chaos** — Simultaneous shouting is the point

## Where to Get It

- **Official:** Game stores and online
- **DIY:** Any deck with distinct visuals (standard cards, Uno, themed decks)
